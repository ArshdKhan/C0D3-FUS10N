# Keto
## Background:
In organic chemistry, ketones are a type of carbonyl compound where the carbonyl group is bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups. The structure of ketones can be identified based on their chemical formula and chain length.

## Question:
Find the flag from the following ketones!
```
CH3     CH3-CO-CH2-CH3        O
 |                            ||
 |                           / \
C=O                         /   \
 |                         |     |
CH3                         \   / 
                             \_/
```
## Flag Format:
```
flag_raid{<first letter of each ketone name in CAPS><carbon chain length of each ketone>}
```
Note: There are no spaces in the flag.
