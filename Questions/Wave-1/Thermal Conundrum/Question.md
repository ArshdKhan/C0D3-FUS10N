# The Thermal Conundrum
## Background: 
In thermodynamics, understanding the laws of heat transfer and the behavior of gases is crucial for solving real-world problems.

## Question: 
Consider an ideal gas contained in a cylinder with a movable piston. 
The gas initially occupies a volume of 
𝑉<sub>1</sub> = 0.5 m<sup>3</sup> 
at a temperature of 
𝑇<sub>1</sub> = 300 K and pressure 𝑃<sub>1</sub> = 100 kPa.
The gas is then compressed isothermally to a new volume 
𝑉<sub>2</sub> = 0.2 m<sup>3</sup>.

In the .exe file attached, the value of 𝑃<sub>2</sub> (in kPa) is the password which reveals the flag.

### Hint:
Run the .exe file in terminal so the flag can be viewed properly.

## Flag Format:
`FLAG-RAID{W_work}` where `work` is the work done on the gas during the compression.
