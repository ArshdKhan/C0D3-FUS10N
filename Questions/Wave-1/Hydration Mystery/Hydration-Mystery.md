# Hydration Mystery
## Background:
In organic chemistry, certain reactions transform unsaturated compounds into valuable alcohols through hydration processes. Understanding these reactions is crucial for synthesizing various organic compounds.

## Question:
What two-step process yields liquid treasures from unsaturated beginnings?

RCH=CHR'       →        RCH(OH)-CH2R'    →    RCH(OH)-CH2R'
         [Hg(OAc)2/H2O]               [NaBH4]
