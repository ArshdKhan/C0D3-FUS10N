# CTF Question: The Chemical Reaction Riddle
## Background:
In organic chemistry, the understanding of reaction rates and equilibrium is crucial for predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions.

## Question:
Consider the following hypothetical reaction involving the formation of a product 𝑃 from reactants 𝐴 and 𝐵:

𝐴 + 2𝐵 ⇌ 𝑃

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

[𝐴] = 0.85 mol/L
[𝐵] = 0.67 mol/L
[𝑃] = 0.02 mol/L

### Flag Format:
`FLAG-RAID{Kc_value}` and replace `Kc_value` with the answer.
