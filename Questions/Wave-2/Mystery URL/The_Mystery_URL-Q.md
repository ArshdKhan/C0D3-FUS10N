# The Mystery URL

### Level:
Easy

## Description:
Your mission is to explore [https://ctf-challenge-platform.netlify.app/](https://ctf-challenge-platform.netlify.app/) and uncover a secret message.
The message is somewhere in the website, play around with the URL and its directories to find it.

### Hint:
Websites sometimes store important files in hidden directories that aren't easy to find.
Try appending common directory names like `/hidden/` or `/flag/` to the URL and see if you can discover anything unusual.
Donâ€™t forget to experiment with different file extensions, such as `.txt`, to see if there's a hidden file waiting for you!

## Flag Format:
`flag-raid{enter_the_message}`
