# CTF Challenge: Mystic Vault

**Category:** Reverse Engineering

**Difficulty:** Hard

## Question
In a distant land, atop the towering mountains, lies a mystical vault filled with treasure beyond imagination. This vault is guarded by three ancient spirits who hold the secret to unlocking its door. To gain access, you must guess a specific number hidden deep within the vault's legendâ€”a number between 1 and 10,000,000.

You have three attempts to uncover this number. With each incorrect guess, the spirits will offer you a hint, guiding you to aim higher or lower. If you succeed in guessing the number, the treasure will be yours, but if you fail, the vault will remain sealed forever.

As you stand before the ancient door, you ponder your options:

Will you guess the number? Will you search for another way to open the vault? Or will you give up and leave the treasure hidden for eternity?

Choose wisely, brave adventurer! What will you do?
