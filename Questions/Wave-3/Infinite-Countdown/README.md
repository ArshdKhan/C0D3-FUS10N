# Infinite Countdown

---

You've discovered an computer program. This mysterious software, known as Infinite Countdown, was designed to protect sensitive information using a unique time-based mechanism. The program reveals a secret flag, but with a twist: it asks a series of questions, and after each correct answer, it reveals a part of the flag. However, there's a catch the waiting time between questions increases exponentially.
Your mission is to extract the complete flag from this enigmatic program. Can you answer all the questions correctly and endure the ever-increasing wait times, or perhaps find a more efficient way to retrieve the flag?

The program reveals the flag in 6 parts.
Each correct answer reveals a part of the flag.
An incorrect answer ends the program, forcing you to start over.

## Executable File

Download the executable file [here](/infinite_countdown.exe).

## Hint

The program reveals the flag with exponentially increasing delays. Can you find a more efficient way to extract the flag? Things that seem complicated might not be as complex as they appear.

## Flag Format

Once you've deciphered the flag from the executable, format it as follows: `FLAG-RAID{<_message_>}`

## Good Luck

Use your skills to overcome the exponential delays and retrieve the hidden flag efficiently. Remember, in the world of cryptography, patience is a virtue, but clever thinking is the key to success!
