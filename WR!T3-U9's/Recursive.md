### Challenge Description:

In the "Recursive Product Puzzle," youâ€™re given a recursive function recursive_product(n) with two missing values labeled as **a** and **b**. The function takes an integer n and returns a computed result based on the values of n. You are tasked with identifying the missing values **a** and **b** that make the function return the correct outputs for the given examples.

## The outputs for specific inputs are:

recursive_product(3) returns 21
recursive_product(4) returns 64
recursive_product(5) returns 325
Once you figure out the missing values for **a** and **b**, you can reveal the flag format: FLAG-RAID{ab}.

## Hints:

Look closely at the outputs for n = 3, n = 4, and n = 5 and try to deduce a pattern in how the results are calculated.

## Consider using trial and error or solving the recursive relation to find the values for **a** and **b**.

## Once you identify **a** and **b**, combine them to reveal the flag.
