#### Challenge Description:

In "The Horcrux Hunt," Harry Potter has stumbled upon a list of cryptic numbers that are believed to represent the locations of Voldemort's horcruxes. Each number corresponds to a specific country, and your task is to help Harry decode these numbers by identifying the countries they represent. The first letter of each country will then lead you to the final location of the last horcrux. The final answer will spell out a six-letter name, representing the hidden location.

You are provided with the following numbers:

-   251
-   1
-   20
-   34
-   92
-   86

The goal is to identify the countries associated with these numbers, take the first letter of each country, and arrange them to spell the final location.

#### Hints:

1. Each number is a country phone code, so look for the corresponding country for each phone code.
2. Once you have the countries, take the first letter of each country’s name.
3. Rearrange these letters to spell "PESUEC," which is a clue to the final location.

2. Extract the First Letters:
   Take the first letter of each country’s name:

    - Ethiopia -> E
    - United States -> U
    - Egypt -> E
    - Spain -> S
    - Pakistan -> P
    - China -> C

3. Rearrange the Letters:
   Rearranging the letters E, U, E, S, P, C gives PESUEC.

4. Find the Final Location:
   The final location is PESUEC, which represents the name of a college.

5. Conclude the Solution:
   The flag will be in the format: `FLAG-RAID{PESUEC}`.
