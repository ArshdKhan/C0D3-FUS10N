### Challenge Description:

In "Weak When Alone, Strong When United," you are given a set of numbers that may seem arbitrary at first glance. However, when you combine them correctly, they reveal something significant. Your task is to find the hidden meaning behind the numbers and identify what unites them.

The numbers provided are pairs of latitude and longitude coordinates. Each of these pairs points to a location of major geopolitical significance. Together, these locations share a common connection that is vital on the global stage.

### Hints:

These latitude and longitude pairs represent the locations of key cities around the world.
Focus on identifying the group or organization that links these locations together.
These countries share a global economic and political significance.

### Steps to Solve:

Analyze the Coordinates: The first step is to map out each set of latitude and longitude coordinates. You can use tools like Google Maps or any geographical software to pinpoint each location.

Identify the Locations: Once the coordinates are mapped, you'll notice that they correspond to the capitals or major cities of prominent countries. For example:

-34.6037, -58.3816: Buenos Aires, Argentina
45.4215, -75.6972: Ottawa, Canada
39.9042, 116.4074: Beijing, China

And so on.

### Find the Common Link: After identifying all 20 cities, the next task is to find what ties these countries together. You'll discover that these cities are from countries that are members of the Group of Twenty (G20), an international forum for governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union (EU).

Conclude the Solution: The common factor is that these countries are all part of the G20. Therefore, the answer to the challenge is "G20."
