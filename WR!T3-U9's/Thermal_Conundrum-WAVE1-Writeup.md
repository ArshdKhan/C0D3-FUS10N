## Steps:

#### Step 1: 
Calculate the value of 𝑃<sub>2</sub> using 𝑃<sub>1</sub>𝑉<sub>1</sub> = 𝑃<sub>2</sub>𝑉<sub>2</sub> when other values are given.

Finally it's found that:
𝑃<sub>2</sub> = 250

#### Step 2: 
On running the .exe file in terminal, participants are prompted to enter the password (value of 𝑃<sub>2</sub>).

On entering the correct password (250), the flag is revealed:

``` 
FLAG-RAID{W_45814.54}
```

#### Or from a hint in flag format:
```
FLAG-RAID{W_work}
```

where `work` is the work done on the gas during the compression.

The flag can also be calculated directly using this hint.
